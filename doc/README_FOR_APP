Requirements
============
* Tested on Ruby 1.9.1 with Ruby on Rails 2.3.3. May work with other versions,
  but no guarantees.
* Requires no external gems (aside from mysql).
* Requires an internet connection for downloading Google's copy of jQuery.
* Requires MySQL to be installed. Expects the following settings:
  - db name: scvn_dev
  - host: localhost
  If you'd like to use different settings, or you're using a username and
  password, you'll need to go into /config/database.yml and change the settings
